This came out from a real life problem.
You can resize a single image via terminal quite easily.
You can resize a full folder of images easily as well. But you need to install pretty big softwares for that.

Resimage comes up with a simple solution. A tiny, less than 10KB software, which is solely created to resize images in a folder pretty easily.
Show the folder.
Give the height and width.
Decide whether to maintain aspect ratio or not.
Sit back and enjoy.
